# Your Task

Generate two distinct markdown sections for a bot performance analysis report:

## 1. Analysis Overview (~200 words)
Create a concise executive summary that would appear at the top of the analysis report page. This should:
- Briefly describe the analysis scope and methodology based on the data provided
- Highlight key performance metrics (containment rate, top intents, etc.)
- Summarize the most important findings from the session data
- Use a professional tone appropriate for bot analysis teams
- Include relevant statistics and percentages from the actual data
- Be formatted in clean markdown

## 2. Analysis Summary (~400-600 words)
Create a detailed analysis that would appear at the bottom of the report page. This should:
- Provide deeper insights into bot performance patterns based on the session data
- Focus on containment improvement opportunities derived from transfer patterns
- Identify specific pain points causing transfers to live agents based on transfer reasons and drop-off locations
- Suggest actionable improvements for UX, task completion, and bot training based on the conversation patterns observed
- Reference specific data from the analysis (transfer reasons, drop-off locations, intent patterns)
- Maintain a consultative, expert tone appropriate for bot optimization
- Use structured markdown with headers, bullet points, and emphasis
- Include data-driven recommendations based on the session patterns and user behavior observed

## 3. Containment Improvement Suggestion (1 sentence)
Create a single, actionable sentence that explains the most impactful change that could be made to improve bot containment based on the analysis data. This should:
- Be specific and actionable, not generic advice
- Reference the actual data patterns observed (top transfer reasons, drop-off locations, etc.)
- Focus on the highest-impact improvement opportunity
- Be concise and fit nicely in a card display
- Use engaging, professional language appropriate for stakeholders
- Include a specific metric or percentage when relevant

Examples of good containment suggestions:
- "Improve account verification flow to reduce 34% of transfers caused by authentication issues"
- "Add proactive clarification prompts during billing inquiries to contain 28% more sessions"
- "Expand knowledge base for technical issues to handle the 19% of sessions that transfer due to connectivity problems"

All three sections should be written from the perspective of a bot performance analyst providing insights to improve bot effectiveness and user experience based on the conversation data analyzed.

Format your response as:

# ANALYSIS_OVERVIEW
[overview markdown content]

# ANALYSIS_SUMMARY  
[detailed analysis markdown content]

# CONTAINMENT_SUGGESTION
[single actionable sentence for improving containment]
