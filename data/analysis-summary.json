  "overview": "This report presents a concise analysis of the **XO bot's performance** based on 50 conversation sessions conducted during the analysis period of July 7, 2025. The evaluation utilized advanced methodologies powered by AI to assess user interactions, identify trends, and highlight improvement opportunities. \n\nKey performance metrics include a **transfer rate of 26.0%**, with **13 sessions transferred** and **37 contained**. The **average session length** was **10.0 minutes**, yielding **8.0 messages per session**. The top intents driving user engagement were:\n- **Technical Support** (18.0%)\n- **Eligibility** (16.0%)\n- **Policy Information** (12.0%)\n\n**Critical Findings:**\n- Notable transfer reasons include *No Provider ID* (6.0%) and *Can't Capture Policy Number* (4.0%).\n- User drop-off points primarily occurred during *Contact Verification* (6.0%) and *Provider ID* prompts (4.0%).\n- A significant portion of sessions successfully completed inquiries through the self-service flow, indicating a generally effective bot design.",
